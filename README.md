# GraphQL-BookFinder

# Description

This project is a MERN stack application that utilizes GraphQL with Apollo Server to provide a book search engine. Originally built with a RESTful API, this application has been refactored to leverage the power of GraphQL, enhancing its performance and user experience. Users can search for books via the Google Books API, save their favorites, and manage their saved list, all within a personalized user experience.
